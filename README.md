## Terraform Azure Examples

[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro) is one of the open source tools that was introduced to the market by HashiCorp in 2014 as "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software. IaC means we can write code for our infrastructure, that's used for building, updating, and managing cloud infrastructure. Terraform is "cloud-agnostic" and has support for multiple cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), on-premises infrastructure and many others.  It has simple workflow of terraform init (initialize), terraform plan (plan configuration), terraform apply (create infrastructure).
<br /><br />
Terraform mainly uses Terraform configurationfiles ending with .tf or .tf.json, that hold detailed infrastrucutre about the infrastructure component to be created and/or managed, to run a single application or an entire data center.  Terraform generates an execution plan (terraform plan), which describes what it is going to do to reach the desired state, and then executes it to build the infrastructure described. If there is any change in the configuration file, Terraform is able to determine what has been changed and create incremental execution plans that can be applied.
<br /><br />
My current focus is on Azure services and this repo will reflect it.  I plan to at some point, replicate the Azure configuration files in this repo to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) repository

## Terraform CLI

Terraform CLI is an open source command line application created by Hashicorp allowing you to run difference commands and sub commmands.  The main commands are ```init```, ```plan```, and ```apply```.  The sub commands can be ran as flags after the main command.  Run ```terraform``` from any command line to see the output.
<br /><br />
To get help with any command, simply run ```terraform_command -h``` Ex: ```terraform init -h```
<br/><br />
```
